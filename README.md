### WORK DAY SCHEDULER

This code creates a daily planner that you can use to save your hourly work events/tasks. 

#### How it works:
* On the landing page, you will see the current day displayed in the header.
* You will be given a workday with hourly blocks from 9AM to 5PM. 
* Each of the time blocks are color coded. 
    - Grey - when the time has passed.
    - Red - when the time is present/current.
    - Green - when the time is in the future.
* Enter event details on the text area provided. Once done, click save.
* The event details remains even when the page is reloaded or refreshed.
